\usage{
downsample_reads(
  read_table,
  output_dir,
  output_sub_dir,
  min_read_count = 1000,
  n_sample = 10000,
  seed = 1L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{read_table}{(Required). The filtered read table includes: sample_id, marker_id, n (number of demultiplexed reads), sample, info, reads_1 (the filtered and trimmed forward fastq file path), reads_2 (the filtered and trimmed reverse fastq file path), n_in (number of reads before filtering and trimming), n_out (number of reads after filtering and trimming).}

\item{output_dir}{(Required). The path to the output downsampled read table file.}

\item{output_sub_dir}{(Required). The path to the output downsampled files.}

\item{min_read_count}{(Optional). Default 1000. The minimum number of reads per sample per marker.}

\item{n_sample}{(Optional). Default 10000. Downsamples an exact number of reads from paired end fastq files.}

\item{seed}{(Optional). Default 1. Random seed for reproducible downsampling.}

\item{threads}{(Optional). Default 2. The hostnames of workers (as a character vector) or the number of localhost workers (as a positive integer).}

\item{count_col}{(Optional). Default NULL. The specified column to downsample reads.}
}
\value{
A downsampled table in RDS format includes sample_id, marker_id, sample, info, reads_1 (the downsampled forward fastq file path), reads_2 (the downsampled reverse fastq file path), n (number of reads after downsampling).
}
\description{
This function downsamples an exact number of reads from paired end fastq files.
